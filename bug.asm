mov eax, [ebx+0x10] ; This instruction attempts to read from memory address ebx+0x10, but ebx might contain an invalid address. This could lead to a segmentation fault or other unpredictable behavior.

mov ecx, [esi+eax*4] ; This instruction uses the value in eax as an index, but eax may not be within the valid range of indices for the array pointed to by esi.  This will cause an out of bounds read resulting in unpredictable data or a crash.
